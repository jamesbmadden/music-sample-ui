# Music Sample App
Sample Web App UI showing Artist profiles and albums.

## Artist Page
The artist page shows the Artist's Spotify header, and lists their albums, and Singles and EPs. Clicking on an Album or Single will show the Album view (Only on Ariana Grande's Page).

To view a different Artist's page, scroll to the bottom of the artist view, and use the buttons to navigate.

## Album Page
The album page shows the album art, and lists the tracks with their title, artists, whether they're explicit, and their length. Clicking on an artist will take you to their artist page (Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, and Alessia Cara are the only artists with artist pages).
